\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this document is to describe how a particular combinatorial
optimization problem was solved by adopting several approaches in order to
obtaining a value for the objective function in a limited amount of time without
losing too much quality in the goodness of the solution.

\subsection{(Brief) Problem description}
The assignment is an instance of the classical \textit{Travelling Salesman
Problem}: a company has to drill holes on a board, so that electrical components
can be placed over the board by inserting their pins into the holes. The goal
that the company is trying to achieve is to minimize the time the drill
takes to make all the holes\footnote{as well as the distance that the drill
covers by moving}.

I will refer to this problem as the \textbf{drilling problem} from now on.

\paragraph{Assumptions}
\begin{itemize}
  \item the starting point can be arbitrarily chosen;
  \item the time that is needed to move from a node $i$ to a node $j$ depends
    \textit{only} on the distance \dist{i}{j}.
\end{itemize}
